Hi, I'm currently struggling to clean up the assets and other heavy stuff to
be able to upload this to GitHub. Probably will be a couple of hours, so if you see this,
it'll be in a giffy. Also, I'm not changing any code, merely trying to get this
into GitHub. Also, I've been working for some 16 hrs today, so please have mercy XD

-----------------

Oh, it actually didn't even take that long. I didn't removed many assets though, but I've
excluded Library and Temp folders. Hope, it won't affect the buildability. Anyhoo, it's
pretty late and my eyes start shriveling already. Have a nice time of the day, folks
